# Project Understanding Skill

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge of the network topology requirements and project milestones.

## Capabilities

Understand:
- **Network Topology**: Entire network topology used in the project
- **Project Milestones**: Planned project milestones, including ones that may have already been implemented

## When to Use

- **Analyzing Issues**: Use when verifying issues found in current implementation
- **Reviewing Implementation Plan**: Use to analyze if an implementation plan can solve the problem within requirements
- **Optimizing Solution**: Use to create an extensible and accurate solution

## Example Usage

"Implement the following feature with these requirements: ..."

"Analyze if this approach could work: ..."

"Check why this issue happens: ..."

## References

- `TOPOLOGY.md`: Contains the overall network topology used in the project.
- `PROJECT_MILESTONES.py`: All planned features to be achieved in the project

## Notes
- More project milestones may be added overtime
- More details may be added to the topology

## Best Practices

1. Confirm for any inconsistencies between task and requirements.
2. Ask to update the document if necessary.
