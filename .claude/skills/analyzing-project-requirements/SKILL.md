# Project Understanding Skill

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge of the network topology requirements and project milestones.

## Capabilities

Understand:
- **Network Topology**: Entire network topology used in the project
- **Project Milestones**: Planned project milestones, including ones that may have already been implemented

## Use Cases

- **Analyzing and Debugging Issues**: Use when verifying issues found in current implementation
- **Reviewing Implementation Plan**: Use to analyze if an implementation plan can solve the problem within requirements
- **Optimizing Solution**: Use to create an extensible and accurate solution

## Example Usage

"Understand the topology"

"Create an implementation plan to allow communication to peer network's AS65xx0"

"Analyze why BGP session is not established although frr0 can ping to AS65000 BGP speaker"

## References

- `TOPOLOGY.md`: Contains the overall network topology used in the project.
- `PROJECT_MILESTONES.py`: All planned features to be achieved in the project

## Notes
- More project milestones may be added overtime
- More details may be added to the topology

## Best Practices

1. Confirm for any inconsistencies between task and requirements.
2. Ask to update the document if necessary.
