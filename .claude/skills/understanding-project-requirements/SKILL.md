# Project Understanding Skill

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge of the network topology requirements and functionality backlogs to be implemented in the project. 

## Capabilities

Understand:
- **Network Topology**: Entire network topology requirements to be achieved in the project
- **Project Backlogs**: All functionalities to be achieved in the project

## References

For network topology, see `TOPOLOGY.md`.
For backlogs, see `PROJECT_BACKLOGS.md`.

## Notes
- More project backlogs may be added
- More details may be added to the topology

## Best Practices
